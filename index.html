        <h1>Magadan</h1>
        <p>
          Magadan is a city located in the extreme North-East of Russia. If you look at a map, you can say that it is literally on the edge of the country, more precisely, at the coordinates 59°34'N, 150°48'E, on the shore of the Sea of Okhotsk. The distance from Magadan to Moscow by motor road is 9,709 km. Seven time zones separate it from the Russian capital. And when the Muscovites are still ceased by their midnight dreams, a new dawn is already breaking in Magadan. Magadan is a multinational city, with more than 80 ethnic groups living on its territory. The population is 99,700 people.

          Magadan is comfortably situated on the shore of the Sea of Okhotsk between the picturesque Nagaeva and Gertnera bays, on the neck connecting the Staritskyi peninsula and the mainland. From the land the city is surrounded by hills that rise 150-170 m above the sea level. The river Magadanka flows through the city, nominally dividing it into two large areas, which are in their turn divided into residential neighborhoods.

          Although the city is on the same latitude as St. Petersburg, Helsinki and Oslo, the nature and the climate are completely different, not similar to the European ones. Magadan climate is subarctic with some features of the coastal. Winter is long, but as the city is next to the sea, temperature fluctuations are somewhat smoothed. Summer is short and cool. The warmest summer month is August with an average daily maximum of +15 ° C. With such temperature range the snow-covered hills surrounding the city are used by skiers and snowboarders almost all year round. The shortest daylight time is 6 hours, and the longest is 19. During the White (Polar) Nights, which occur in June, total darkness never happens.

          Magadan is an amazingly attractive and picturesque city, with developed modern infrastructure and all necessary services. Although in comparison to other Russian cities it is still very young (just turned 79 in 2018), it has something to tell and to surprise with. The appearance and establishment of the city is connected with the times of the gold rush, the exploration of the richest deposits and the beginning of gold mining in the area not yet developed then. In 1929, the East-Evensk camp was built on the shore of the bay, which gave birth to Magadan village that obtained the city status 10 years later, in July of 1939. According to the official version, the name comes from the Even word mongodan, which means sea debris. Today the Magadan region remains the country leader in the extraction of silver and gold. Most gold mining companies’ headquarters are located in the city.
