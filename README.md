### Project 0

I have created this website about my home city Magadan. The website consists of
five .html files, each shows a particular side of the city's life. Technologies
that I used:
 - Bootstrap framework - for general design as well as to create some
 components: navigation bar and cards
 - CSS Grids and CSS Flexbox for blocks arrangement
 - CSS media queries for mobile responsiveness
 - SASS extension language (SCSS formatting)

There are two .scss files in the project. grids.scss contains only CSS grids
formatting. styles.scss contains all other styles that I used in this website.
